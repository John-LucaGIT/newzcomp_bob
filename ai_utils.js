  Return a structured report in JSON format. Add relevant key value pairs such as bias_rating, bias_direction, summary, sources_agree_on, conclusion, recommendations, reasoning, and topic.
  For the summary you should summarize the articles in a few sentences, focusing on the main points and themes.
  For the bias analysis, provide a detailed analysis of the bias present in each article, including the bias rating and direction.
  The sources_agree_on should summarize what all sources agree on, while the conclusion should provide an overall conclusion based on the analysis.
  The recommendations should provide actionable advice for readers and for media outlets.
  The reasoning should explain how you arrived at your conclusions and ratings.

  For the "topic" key, assign one of the following values ONLY: "all", "politics", "technology", "business", "health", "world", "sports", "entertainment", "science", "environment", "education", "breaking".

  Please provide a detailed response and analyze each article thoroughly.

  Important: Please note, if you are only provided with one article OR if the additional articles are the exact same, do not return your analysis as if you are comparing articles. Instead, treat it as a single article analysis.
